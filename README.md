# UBC CPEN 442 - Introduction to Computer Security - Project
## Secure File Share (CloudKey)
The idea of this project is to have a mobile application that allows users to encrypt/decrypt files.

This project is done in collaboration with other students and is split into two sections:

1. Cloud server responsible for pushing notifications to users and storing encryption keys
2. Mobile application for user interaction and encrypting/decrypting files

This repository contains the code for the mobile application
